       <p>The beautiful thing about cybersecurity is that there are no degree requirements to get into the field since you have certain certifications but apart from that most would look for a degree in cybersecurity or something akin to it.  In terms of requirements, you'll need a minimum of a bachelorâ€™s degree to start working in cybersecurity and have familiarity with Unix, Linux, and Windows operating systems.  Have knowledge about SaaS models and cloud computing and lastly require certification like security+, network+, certified ethical hacker.
